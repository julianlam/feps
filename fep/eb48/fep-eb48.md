# FEP-eb48: Hashtags

## Summary

This proposal introduces a standardized method for identifying and displaying
hashtags in posts across the Fediverse. The rules define what constitutes a
hashtag and how it should be parsed and displayed, ensuring consistency and
predictability across different platforms and clients.

## Hashtag Rules

A string is considered a hashtag if it meets the following criteria:

1. It starts with the `#` symbol.
2. It is followed by one or more alphanumeric characters (letters A-Z, a-z, or digits 0-9).
3. It may include underscores (`_`) but must not include any other special characters, spaces, or punctuation within the hashtag itself.

## Examples

The following examples illustrate how hashtags should be identified and
highlighted:

- `#hashtag`
- "`#hashtag`"
- " `#hashtag`"
- (`#hashtag`/#hashtag)
- ( `#hashtag`/#hashtag)
- ( `#hashtag` /#hashtag)
- ( `#hashtag` / `#hashtag`)
- -`#hashtag`
- \_`#hashtag`
- !`#hashtag`
- ?`#hashtag`
- @`#hashtag`
- ;`#hashtag`
- ,`#hashtag`
- .'`#hashtag`
- [`#hashtag`
- &`#hashtag`
- ^`#hashtag`
