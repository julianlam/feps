# FEP-2677: Identifying the Application Actor

## Summary

It is a common pattern in Fediverse applications to have a special
actor of type Application. This is for example the actor at `https://mastodon.example/actor`
for Mastodon or at `https://pleroma.example/internal/fetch` for Pleroma.
This application actor can be fetched with an unsigned request, so it
is possible to use it to fetch public keys.

The goal of this FEP is to provide an explicit mechanism of identifying
the application actor, with the goal of making it usable for further tasks,
e.g.

- Allowing for application to application communication by having
application actor send activities to another application actor's inbox.
- Having an object one can attach further information to. This means, one
could attach a list of implemented FEPs to the application actor.

## Requirements

The key word "MUST"  in this specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

Following [NodeInfo], see also [FEP-f1d5], a Fediverse application implementing this
FEP, i.e. FEP-2677, MUST provide the well-known path `/.well-known/nodeinfo` and serve a document in JRD format [RFC 7033].
This document MUST then contain a link with relation `https://purl.archive.org/funfedi/applicationActor`,
whose link resolves to an actor of type `Application` (see [ActivityPub]). This actor MUST be retrievable with an unsigned HTTP request.

## Example

We will consider the server with domain `node.example`. This means that a request
to `https://node.example/.well-known/nodeinfo` will resolve to

```json
 {
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",
            "href": "https://node.example/nodeinfo/2.0"
        },
        {
            "rel": "https://purl.archive.org/funfedi/applicationActor",
            "href": "https://node.example/actor"
        }
    ]
 }
```

Next, a request to `https://node.example/actor` with accept header `application/activity+json`
could return

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
    ],
    "id": "https://node.example/actor",
    "type": "Application",
    "inbox": "https://node.example/actor/inbox",
    "outbox": "https://node.example/actor/outbox",
    "publicKey": {
        "id": "https://node.example/actor#main-key",
        "owner": "https://node.example/actor",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n....\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
    }
}
```
