# FEP-7d8c: Documentation: Automation of FEP

## Summary

This FEP discusses scripts and woodpecker configuration used to automate parts of the FEP process. The FEP process is described in [FEP-a4ed][a4ed].

As [FEP-a4ed][a4ed], this is a living document, and should be updated as the FEP process evolves.

## Vision

Automation has the goal of reducing the burden on facilitators by:

- allowing people without deep knowledge of git to become facilitators. Basically, the job will boil down to read a document and ensure it meets our standards, then click "merge".
- performing as many checks as possible via automation

Once one has simplified this job, one can seek broader adoption of the FEP process..

### Todos

This is a living document. So let's have a todo list

- [ ] Check for broken links
- [ ] Simplify creating FEPs. Does one really need git and a codeberg account?
- [ ] Code documentation to enable more people to write tools, e.g. an automatic generation of which FEP is used where

The first two items have been on my personal todo list for a long time, and might stay there ... so feel free to pick them up.

## Automation

Automation for the FEP repository uses the [codeberg woodpecker](https://ci.codeberg.org). There are two jobs:

- test runs basic checks on the contained FEPs
- readme updates the `README.md` file and creates the tracking issue

Automation code is written in python and is contained in the [script folder](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/scripts).

## Configuration variables

To be able to do these configuration tasks, you need to be in the __admin__ group. See the
first discussion [here](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/fep-repo-rights/4797/2).

The configuration [.woodpecker/readme.yml](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/.woodpecker/woodpecker.yml) uses two secrets:

- codeberg_api_token, a codeberg API token used to create the tracking issues.
- deploy_key, an SSH private key used to push to the codeberg repository.

Furthermore, the environment variable `CI_REPO_CLONE_SSH_URL` is used see [woodpecker documentation](https://woodpecker-ci.org/docs/usage/environment).

We will now discuss how to obtain these secrets.

### The api token

API tokens can be generated on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/user/settings) under user settings -> `applications` -> `select permissions` -> `issue`: `Read and Write` and giving it a name. They are hexstrings with 40 characters (if I counted correctly), e.g.

```text
33104dd6847e87ef3d6925effdfc852349233034
```

### Deploy key

As already mentioned the deploy key is an ssh key. One can generate these on linux via

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f deploy_key
```

Do not specify a passphrase. Examples:

``` bash
$ cat deploy_key
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW

yc4IItbRywYagWCKNBGLAAAADWhlbGdlQHJhaW5ib3c=
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
$ cat deploy_key.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJDleo8J28c8ey6SE9L5EwOkyc4IItbRywYagWCKNBGL helge@rainbow
```

The public key `deploy_key.pub` should be added to the codeberg repo under `settings` -> `deploy keys` -> `add deploy key` and checking the `enable write access` checkbox.

See [here](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/settings/keys).

### Adding the secrets to woodpecker

One can add these secrets on [woodpecker](https://ci.codeberg.org/repos/12388), then selecting the settings wheel -> `secrets` -> `add secret`. The secrets only need to available for the `push` action (corresponding to a merged pull request).
