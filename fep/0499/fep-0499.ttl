	dcterms:abstract "This FEP introduces a server-wide endpoint for delivering activities to multiple inboxes. sharedInbox currently allows for doing this, but it requires the remote server to know how to deliver the activity based on its addressing properties. However, the remote server might not know how to deliver the activity to private recipients, or recipients within a collection. The multibox endpoint removes this knowledge requirement from the receiving server and instead makes the sending server responsible for marking inboxes to explicitly deliver to." ;
