# FEP-2931: Representing context with a Collection


## Summary

[FEP-7888][7888] attempts to lay out clarifications for the use of the `context` property based on rationale and history, in which `context` is used primarily to logically group objects related by their "context", or in other words, stating that some object "was created in relation to" another object, where the latter object denotes some purpose for the first object. 

In response to FEP-7888, and motivated by the desire to backfill entire conversations, various softwares wishing to federate have chosen to directly represent `context` as a Collection of objects acknowledged to be "within" some canonical context collection. This FEP describes this approach, its usages, and some drawbacks.

## The concept of a canonical context collection

[FEP-7888][7888] describes the concept of "Canonical collections of objects within an authoritative context" as a case where, if a `context` dereferences to some object, then the `type` of that resolved object can indicate a certain relation as representing the "canonical collection". In the case of this FEP, the "canonical collection" is the Collection itself. This gives us the following normative description:

- When a `context` property is dereferenceable to an object that is a `Collection` or `OrderedCollection`, the canonical context collection is `id`.

### Example representation of a context Collection

(This section is non-normative.)

```json
{
	"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
	"id": "https://posts.example/1",
	"type": "Note",
	"context": {
		"id": "https://conversation.example",
		"type": "OrderedCollection",
		"items": [
			"https://posts.example/1",
			"https://posts.example/2",
			"https://posts.example/5"
		]
	}
}
```

## Consuming a context Collection

(This section is non-normative.)

The context represented by a Collection can be processed (for example, for backfill purposes) by iteratively processing its `items` (or `orderedItems` if expressed using that JSON-LD term) and considering them to be logically grouped together.

## Producing and maintaining a context Collection

(This section is non-normative.)

The protocol for becoming aware of or discovering objects claiming to be included within your context are out of scope for this FEP. However, if you encounter an object claiming your context, then it can be Added directly to the Collection.

## Drawbacks

(This section is non-normative.)

### Collections cannot be cleanly followed via C2S outbox delivery

Using a Collection type forcibly opts that object into certain spec behaviors defined by [ActivityPub][AP]. Namely, if you are using a context collection, and you wish to make your Collection followable, the naive approach is to make it into an ActivityPub actor by giving it an `inbox` that can at least respond to Follow activities with an Accept Follow. However, there is [an issue][GH486] with the outbox delivery algorithm defined in the ActivityPub client-to-server API, wherein the inbox discovery algorithm necessarily always attempts to iterate over every single item in the Collection, not just the Collection itself. This behavior is triggered whenever an ActivityPub outbox receives a payload with an addressing property such as `to`, `cc`, `bto`, `bcc`, or `audience`. For a context Collection that is also an AP actor, addressing this Collection can be unintentionally costly to the server performing delivery, as this server is expected to attempt iteration over potentially unbounded numerous items from the Collection.

For example, given the following activity:

```json
{
	"@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
	"id": "https://activity.example",
	"type": "Announce",
	"object": "https://posts.example/7",
	"to": "https://conversation.example"
}
```

The intention might be to only POST to the `inbox` of `https://conversation.example` (and thus notify the context Collection of `https://posts.example/7` existing), but the outbox delivery algorithm as currently defined at the time of writing this FEP will instead attempt delivery to *all* of the following `inbox` properties it can find across the following objects:

- `https://conversation.example`
  - `https://posts.example/1`
  - `https://posts.example/2`
  - `https://posts.example/5`

There is no way to opt out of this "Collection expansion" behavior. Consequently, following a context Collection cannot be done via naive ActivityPub. See [FEP-efda: Followable objects][efda] for a potential workaround, where the `Follow` activity is addressed to `attributedTo` and sent to `attributedTo.inbox` instead of being addressed directly to `id` and delivered to `id.inbox`.

This problem does not occur if the ActivityPub "POST to outbox" is not used, and instead the `Follow` activity is delivered directly with [Linked Data Notifications][LDN] "POST to inbox".

### Semantic confusion between objects and collections of objects

When modeling explicit concepts such as a "conversation", there is a difference between saying that "a conversation *is* a collection of posts", versus saying that "a conversation *has* a collection of posts". The former relation ("is a") may be imprecise or may prevent declaring other relations in a way that makes sense. The latter relation ("has a") allows for declaring properties of the Conversation that are not properties of the collection of posts instead.
