# FEP-c0e0: Emoji reactions

## Summary

This document describes how emoji reactions are implemented in [ActivityPub] network.

## History

Misskey supports emoji reactions since version [10.97.0](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/releases/tag/10.97.0) (2019).  
Pleroma supports emoji reactions since version [2.0.0](https://pleroma.social/announcements/2020/03/08/pleroma-major-release-2-0-0/) (2020).

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

## EmojiReact activity

`EmojiReact` activity type is considered to be a part of [LitePub] vocabulary. Its full IRI is `http://litepub.social/ns#EmojiReact`.

This activity is similar to `Like` activity. In addition to standard properties of `Like` activity, `EmojiReact` activity MUST have a `content` property. Reaction content MUST be either a single unicode grapheme, or a shortcode of a custom emoji. The shortcode MUST be enclosed in colons.

If custom emoji is used, `EmojiReact` activity MUST have a `tag` property containing a single `Emoji` object (which is specified in [Mastodon ActivityPub extension documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Emoji)). The value of its `name` property MUST be a shortcode that matches the shortcode in reaction content, and it SHOULD be enclosed in colons. The embedded `Emoji` can originate from a server that is different from the actor's server.

An actor can generate multiple `EmojiReact` activities for a single `object`. However, implementers MAY choose to not allow more than one reaction with the same emoji, or more than one reaction per object.

Example with unicode emoji:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "litepub": "http://litepub.social/ns#",
      "EmojiReact": "litepub:EmojiReact"
    }
  ],
  "actor": "https://alice.social/users/alice",
  "content": "ðŸ”¥",
  "id": "https://alice.social/activities/65379d47-b7aa-4ef6-8e4f-41149dda1d2c",
  "object": "https://bob.social/objects/57caeb99-424c-4692-b74f-0a6682050932",
  "to": [
    "https://alice.social/users/alice/followers",
    "https://bob.social/users/bob"
  ],
  "type": "EmojiReact"
}
```

Example with custom emoji:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "Emoji": "toot:Emoji",
      "litepub": "http://litepub.social/ns#",
      "EmojiReact": "litepub:EmojiReact"
    }
  ],
  "actor": "https://alice.social/users/alice",
  "content": ":blobwtfnotlikethis:",
  "id": "https://alice.social/activities/65379d47-b7aa-4ef6-8e4f-41149dda1d2c",
  "object": "https://bob.social/objects/57caeb99-424c-4692-b74f-0a6682050932",
  "tag": [
    {
      "icon": {
        "mediaType": "image/png",
        "type": "Image",
        "url": "https://alice.social/files/1b0510f2-1fb4-43f5-a399-10053bbd8f0f"
      },
      "id": "https://alice.social/emojis/blobwtfnotlikethis",
      "name": ":blobwtfnotlikethis:",
      "type": "Emoji",
      "updated": "2024-02-07T02:21:46.497Z"
    }
  ],
  "to": [
    "https://alice.social/users/alice/followers",
    "https://bob.social/users/bob"
  ],
  "type": "EmojiReact"
}
```

## Like with content

Emoji reaction can also be represented as a `Like` activity. This variant of emoji reaction will processed by non-supporting implementations as a regular "like", and when that is preferable, implementers MAY use `Like` type instead of `EmojiReact` type.

Implementations MUST process `Like` with `content` in the same way as `EmojiReact` activities.

## Undo reaction

Emoji reactions can be retracted using a standard `Undo` activity:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
  ],
  "actor": "https://alice.social/users/alice",
  "id": "https://alice.social/activities/99b8f47b-f3a9-4cf5-94a2-95352e7462d6",
  "object": "https://alice.social/activities/65379d47-b7aa-4ef6-8e4f-41149dda1d2c",
  "to": [
    "https://alice.social/users/alice/followers",
    "https://bob.social/users/bob"
  ],
  "type": "Undo"
}
```

## Implementations

This document is based on implementations of emoji reactions in Misskey and Pleroma.
