# FEP-7888: Demystifying the context property

## Summary

ActivityStreams Vocabulary defines the `context` property, but it is "intentionally vague". Unfortunately, this makes the definition so vague as to be practically useless. This FEP aims to provide more guidance on possible uses of the `context` property, as well as formalizing some best practices.

## Preamble

(This section is non-normative.)

See "Appendix A: Rationale" for fuller analysis of the definition, as well as use cases that can be mapped onto `context`.

In short:

- It is possible for objects to exist within implicit contexts. For example, you might group all objects sharing a certain `tag`, or all objects having a common `audience`. 
- An explicit `context` embodies *purpose*. Things grouped by the same `context` "belong together" in a way that can't be said about things grouped by the same `tag`.
- Objects with a `context` exist *within* that context, and are meant to be seen and interpreted *in context of* something else. In most cases, you do not want to view the object on its own; it should be viewed together with other objects, contextually.
- You might use `context` to represent a "thread", "topic", "conversation", "room", "channel", "forum", "wall", "guild", "space", "project", or so on.

## Publishing `context`

When generating an object with a `context` as a publisher:

### Purpose

A `context` SHOULD have a purpose; consider `tag` for looser references. Objects sharing a certain `context` SHOULD be strongly related and intended to be viewed in the same grouping.

### Dereferencing and resolving

A `context` SHOULD be resolvable. The resolved object or link can describe the context with at least the additional information needed to fully process the activity or object. Examples of generally useful properties include but are not limited to:

- `attributedTo` denotes the authority for that context. (This authority might be a good target for addressing and delivery of related activities.)
- `audience` indicates intent for or potential interest by some entities. (These entities might be a good target for addressing and delivery of related activities.)
- `followers` signals that the context might be a followable object. (This followers collection might be a good target for addressing and delivery of related activities.)
- `outbox` might contain relevant Activities performed by the context, if it is an actor.

Ideally, the resolved `context` SHOULD in some way have an associated Collection which can contain the related items. (The exact semantics of discovering this Collection are out of scope of this FEP.)

## Consuming `context`

When encountering an object with a `context` as a consumer or browser:

### Group objects by `context`

At minimum, you SHOULD consider the current object alongside other objects referencing the same `context` (by `id`) instead of considering the current object independently. By default, the graph source for objects that are being considered for inclusion is arbitrary. This can be some dataset, or it can be some relevant collection's items. For example, you might conssider the outbox and/or inbox of one or more actors, or you might consider a specific property path on the `context` (if resolvable).

### Canonical collections of objects within an authoritative context

If the `context` resolves to an object of a certain type, then that type MAY indicate that a certain relation represents a canonical Collection of all objects that the authority considers to be included. (The definition of such types and relations is out of scope of this FEP.)

For authoritative contexts that include such a canonical Collection, you SHOULD NOT assume that an object has been accepted into that collection simply because it declares `context`. Consumers SHOULD make efforts to verify reverse claims of inclusion. If a client or user-agent is unable to verify this claim, then the client or user-agent SHOULD indicate to users that the object's claim of being included in the authoritative context is unverified. Criteria for establishing proof of inclusion in a collection is out of scope for this FEP, but might include:

- Viewing the collection directly and encountering the object as a collection item
- Querying the collection via some querying mechanism that allows determining if a given object is included in a collection.
- Having knowledge that the authority Added the object to the collection, with knowledge that the object wasn't subsequently Removed.

## Interacting with `context`

### Sending an interaction with or without `context`

When encountering an object with a `context` and choosing to author your own object or activity that interacts with this object:

- You MAY copy a `context` as-is, if you wish for your object to be included in that same context.
  - If you do this, you SHOULD send your activity to the owner(s) of the context(s), defined via `context.attributedTo` if resolvable. This is similar to how one might address the author of an object that they are responding to via `inReplyTo.attributedTo`, as a social courtesy.
- You MAY set your own `context`, if you wish for your object to exist in a different context.
- You MAY remove the `context` entirely, if you wish for your object to exist on its own.

Note that `context` can be present on either the object, the activity, or both. It is also possible for different `context` references to be placed on each. This depends on how `context` is used. In the case of an activity wrapping an object with context, if the activity is deemed to exist in the same context as the object, then you SHOULD use the same `context` reference on both the object and also on its wrapping activity.

### Receiving an interaction with your `context`

Upon receipt of an activity where a `context` is owned by you, or where the activity's `object` has a `context` owned by you:

You SHOULD distribute the object or activity that declares your `context` to the audience of that context. The audience of the context MAY be possibly specified by `context.audience`, and MAY possibly include `context.followers` if the context is itself an actor.

Distribution to the audience of the context MAY be done by the following mechanisms:

- Inbox forwarding. If the object or activity to be distributed addresses `context.audience` and/or `context.followers` as collections, then inbox forwarding MAY suffice to notify interested actors about the new activity or object. (Verification mechanisms for inbox forwarding are out-of-scope for this FEP.)
- Add activity. To properly manage the canonical collection's state (when the context has a canonical collection associated with it), the context owner SHOULD locally Add the appropriate object or activity to the canonical collection. This Add activity MAY also be delivered over ActivityPub S2S while addressing the `context.audience` and/or `context.followers` as recipients, serving as a notification that the object or activity was included in the canonical collection by the context owner.
- Other mechanisms. It is possible that the software managing a context's canonical collection may use other protocols or activity-forms to distribute relevant objects or activities. Non-normative examples include Announce or potential extension activity types.

You MAY drop certain activities not matching specific policies; for example, you might filter out spam, or implement a policy such that only certain actors (members, participants, etc.) are allowed to be included in the context. (Signaling which actors can participate is out-of-scope for this FEP and may be covered in a further FEP.)

## Appendix A: Rationale

(This section is non-normative.)

### The existing definition

From the current definition in [VOCAB]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-context

> Identifies the context within which the object exists or an activity was performed.
> 
> The notion of "context" used is intentionally vague. The intended function is to serve as a means of grouping objects and activities that share a common originating context or purpose. An example could be all activities relating to a common project or event.

Aside from being "intentionally vague", the definition is also somewhat circular; it requires knowing what a context is and having some conceptual understanding of the notion of "context". However, we are given some guidance towards its "intended function", which is to group objects by some common purpose or origin.

### Purpose and intent; or, why not use a tag?

We might similarly use a `tag` for grouping objects and activities. Several fediverse projects often include a `Hashtag` (defined as an extension within the ActivityStreams namespace, but not actually adopted or defined formally). This `Hashtag` signals an intent to be included or discovered through a collection of objects bearing the same `Hashtag`, uniquely identified by its `name`. The maintenance of such implicit collections is assumed to be the responsibility of the receiving server, although an `href` might be provided for convenience, in order to browse the implicit collection of tagged objects as seen from that origin server. (This also makes the `Hashtag` a sub-type of `Link`.)

The key property of such a tag is to signal a general, implicit association by reference. We might then consider a context to be an explicit association, but such an explicit association requires an explicit definition.

### The different types of context, and how they are actually the same

Various dictionaries define context generally as something that helps you understand the situation. Following from this, the context should be something that helps you process the activity or object. Ignoring the context may lead to misunderstanding the activity or object; the object or activity exists *within* that context, and should be understood *in context of* that context.

Specific contexts can be thought of in several applications:

- the "authoritative context" is a context in which some authority can be applied;
- the "conversational context" is a context which represents some conversation and possibly its history;
- the "originating context" is a context which represents some intended starting point that you might look at first.

We might continue to articulate further types of contexts, but the general pattern that emerges is that a context exists to form a purposeful grouping, regardless of the specific purpose. For example, if we had the notion of a conversation, then we might reasonably say that someone owns this conversation and can apply their authority to it. Looking at some object or activity within this context is generally not recommended on its own; it is better to view the entire conversation or some page of it rather than viewing a singular object.

### Sample workflows and use-cases involving context

The context may be presented using the following abstractions:

- A "topic" in a forum presentation
- A "conversation" in a social networking presentation
- A "room" in a chatting or messaging presentation
- A "thread" in any of the above contexts (forum thread, social media thread, chat thread)

Contexts may be associated with other contexts:

- A forum topic/thread may be nested in a "forum" or "forum category", and may be nested in another parent forum as a sub-forum.
- A "wall" on a social networking profile may contain conversations, which in turn contain the posts/comments
- A "guild" or "space" may contain multiple chat rooms with a common audience

It is also possible to *not* have a context. Such objects exist only in the general context of their author (via `attributedTo`) or other implicit contexts, and are otherwise self-sufficient. This can include:

- An article published on a web site, particularly one meant to be accessible directly via a permalink
  - A post in a blogging or microblogging environment, particularly one that does not represent a conversation, or where `inReplyTo` is meant only as a loose reference.
- An activity intended for or acting upon an object without a context

## Appendix B: Examples

(This section is non-normative.)

### Example 1: A minimal example for participating in a context

You encounter the following object:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-object",
  "context": "https://domain.example/some-context",
  "content": "Hello world",
  "summary": "<some-object> exists in <some-context> and has content saying \"Hello world\"."
}
```

You wish to participate in the context, so you dereference the context:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-context",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/context-owner",
  "audience": "https://domain.example/context-audience",
  "type": "https://extension.example/SomeType",
  "https://extension.example/someProperty": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/some-context/collection",
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "orderedItems": ["https://domain.example/some-object"],
  },
  "summary": "<some-context> is a context owned by <context-owner> and with an audience of <context-audience>. It has a canonical collection <some-context/collection> which currently contains <some-object>."
}
```

You send your activity to the context authority, while copying their context:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/your-activity",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/you",
  "type": "Create",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/your-object",
    "context": "https://domain.example/some-context",
    "content": "Hello!"
  },
  "audience": ["https://domain.example/context-owner", "https://domain.example/context-audience"],
  "summary": "<you> Created <your-object> in <some-context>, and are delivering this activity addressing <context-owner> and <context-audience>."
}
```

The context authority then might forward this activity to the context audience.

The context authority also might add your object or message to the context's canonical collection:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/their-activity",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/context-owner",
  "type": "Add",
  "object": "https://domain.example/your-object",
  "target": "https://domain.example/some-context/collection",
  "audience": [
    "https://domain.example/context-owner-followers",
    "https://domain.example/context-audience",
    "https://domain.example/you", // to keep you in the loop
    "https://domain.example/your-followers" // for inbox forwarding
  ],
  "summary": "The <context-owner> Added <your-object> to <some-context/collection>, and they are delivering this activity addressing their followers, the <context-audience>, <you>, and <your-followers>."
}
```

The resulting state of the context's canonical collection is now like so:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-context",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/context-owner",
  "audience": "https://domain.example/context-audience",
  "type": "https://extension.example/SomeType",
  "https://extension.example/someProperty": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/some-context/collection",
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "orderedItems": [
      "https://domain.example/some-object",
      "https://domain.example/your-object"
    ],
  },
  "summary": "<some-context/collection> now contains <some-object> and <your-object> after the latter has been Added to the OrderedCollection by <context-owner>."
}
```

Third-party observers (such as members of `https://domain.example/context-audience`) can validate or identify the Add activity as modifying a canonical collection by using the following checks:

- `Add.actor` == `target.attributedTo` (the actor is allowed to modify a collection that they own)
- `target` == `object.context` (the object is being added into its declared context)

Alternatively, observers can use the Add as a signal to invalidate their cache of the canonical collection and refetch it.

### Example 2: Choosing not to participate in the same context

You encounter the following object:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-object",
  "context": "https://domain.example/some-context",
  "content": "Hello world",
  "summary": "<some-object> exists in <some-context> and has content saying \"Hello world\"."
}
```

You want to establish your own context, separately from the current object's context, so you create a canonical collection to be referenced from a context object, then create that context object. This results in two activities:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/creating-a-context-collection",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/you",
  "type": "Create",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/a-different-context/collection",
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/you"
  },
  "summary": "<you> Created <a-different-context/collection>, which is an OrderedCollection."
}
```

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/creating-a-different-context",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/you",
  "type": "Create",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/a-different-context",
    "type": "https://extension.example/SomeType",
    "https://extension.example/someProperty": "https://domain.example/a-different-context/collection",
    "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/you"
  },
  "summary": "<you> Created <a-different-context>, which is SomeType and has an associated OrderedCollection via someProperty."
}
```

You can now set this new context on your interaction, with the intent that your interaction is shown in a separate grouping from the original object:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/creating-a-post-in-a-different-context",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/you",
  "type": "Create",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/a-post-in-a-different-context",
    "content": "Starting a new thread to say \"Hello World\" in a different context.",
    "inReplyTo": {
      "id": "https://domain.example/some-object",
      "context": "https://domain.example/some-context",
      "content": "Hello world",
      "summary": "<some-object> exists in <some-context> and has content saying \"Hello world\"."
    },
    "context": "https://domain.example/a-different-context"
  },
  "summary": "<you> Created <a-post-in-a-different-context> which is inReplyTo <some-object> in <some-context>, but your object is in <a-different-context>."
}
```

You add your object to your own context's canonical collection:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/their-activity",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/you",
  "type": "Add",
  "object": "https://domain.example/a-post-in-a-different-context",
  "target": "https://domain.example/a-different-context/collection",
  "summary": "<you> Added <a-post-in-a-different-context> to <a-different-context/collection>."
}
```

The original object's context is unchanged:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-context",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/context-owner",
  "audience": "https://domain.example/context-audience",
  "type": "https://extension.example/SomeType",
  "https://extension.example/someProperty": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/some-context/collection",
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "orderedItems": ["https://domain.example/some-object"],
  },
  "summary": "<some-context> is a context owned by <context-owner> and with an audience of <context-audience>. It has a canonical collection <some-context/collection> which currently contains <some-object>."
}
```

Your context now looks like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/a-different-context",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/you",
  "audience": "https://domain.example/some-audience",
  "type": "https://extension.example/SomeType",
  "https://extension.example/someProperty": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/a-different-context/collection",
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "orderedItems": ["https://domain.example/a-post-in-a-different-context"],
  },
  "summary": "<a-different-context> is a context owned by <you> and with an audience of <some-audience>. It has a canonical collection <a-different-context/collection> which currently contains <a-post-in-a-different-context>."
}
```

### Example 3: Encountering multiple contexts

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-object",
  "context": ["https://domain.example/some-context", "https://domain.example/some-other-context"]
  "content": "Hello world",
  "summary": "<some-object> exists in <some-context> and <some-other-context> and has content saying \"Hello world\"."
}
```

You dereference the two contexts:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-context",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/context-owner",
  "type": "Object",
  "summary": "<some-context> is an Object owned by <context-owner>.",
  "https://extension.example/someProperty": "https://domain.example/some-context/collection"
}
```

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-other-context",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/other-context-owner",
  "type": "Object",
  "summary": "<some-other-context> is an Object owned by <other-context-owner>.",
  "https://extension.example/someProperty": "https://domain.example/some-other-context/collection"
}
```

You can now choose to participate in either context, both contexts, a different context, or no context.

To participate in both contexts:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/your-activity",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/you",
  "type": "Create",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://domain.example/your-object",
    "context": ["https://domain.example/some-context", "https://domain.example/some-other-context"],
    "content": "Hello!"
  },
  "audience": ["https://domain.example/context-owner", "https://domain.example/other-context-owner"],
  "summary": "<you> Created <your-object> in <some-context> and <some-other-context>, and are delivering this activity addressing <context-owner> and <other-context-owner>."
}
```

It may be that you are refused addition into some context, but granted addition into some other context:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/context-1-activity",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/context-owner",
  "type": "Reject",
  "object": "https://domain.example/your-activity",
  "summary": "<context-owner> Rejected <your-activity>.",
  "content": "Sorry, I don't want to add your object to my context."
}
```

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/context-2-activity",
  "actor": "https://domain.example/other-context-owner",
  "type": "Add",
  "object": "https://domain.example/your-object",
  "target": "https://domain.example/some-other-context/collection",
  "summary": "<other-context-owner> Added <your-object> to <some-other-context>."
}
```

A third-party observer encounters your object:

```json
{
  "id": "https://domain.example/your-object",
  "context": ["https://domain.example/some-context", "https://domain.example/some-other-context"],
  "content": "Hello!"
}
```

They attempt to verify that your object is included in the first context, and find that it is not included:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-context/collection",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/other-context-owner",
  "type": "OrderedCollection",
  "orderedItems": ["https://domain.example/some-object", "https://domain.example/your-object"],
  "summary": "<some-other-context/collection> is an OrderedCollection owned by <other-context-owner>. It currently contains <some-object> and <your-object>."
}
```

The third-party observer attempts to verify that your object is included in the second context, and finds that it is included:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://domain.example/some-other-context/collection",
  "attributedTo": "https://domain.example/other-context-owner",
  "type": "OrderedCollection",
  "orderedItems": ["https://domain.example/some-other-object", "https://domain.example/your-object"],
  "summary": "<some-other-context/collection> is an OrderedCollection owned by <other-context-owner>. It currently contains <some-other-object> and <your-object>."
}
```

The third-party observer's client renders your object as unverifiably within some context, and verifiably within some other context.

```text
<you> Created <your-object>
<your-object> has content: "Hello!"
<your-object> is part of the following contexts:
- <some-context> (❓ unverified)
- <some-other-context> (✅ verified)
```

The third-party observer may then choose to navigate to (and possibly participate in) the latter context.

## Appendix C: Creating and maintaining contexts and their associated collections using ActivityPub C2S

Because [PUB] does not define the use of `context` as a property or the notion of a canonical collection, it is up to ActivityPub Clients to manage contexts and their canonical collections for themselves. The following algorithm may be used to create an object within a context that has a canonical collection:

1. `Create` the canonical `Collection` that will be associated with the context. Save the generated Collection `id` to be used in the next step.
2. Create the Object that will be used as `context`. If the Object has a canonical Collection associated with it, then specify the appropriate property relation using the `id` from the previous step. Save the generated context `id` to be used in the next step.
3. Create the Object that will exist within the context, and specify the `context` as the `id` from the previous step. Set an appropriate `audience` or use `to`/`cc` to deliver the Create activity as-is. Save the generated object `id` to be used in the next step.
3. Add the Object to the context's canonical Collection, using the `id`s obtained from the responses for steps 1 and 3. You may wish to deliver this Add activity via `to`/`cc`/`audience` targeting your intended recipients, especially if you did not deliver the Create Object from step 3.
