# FEP-6606: ActivityPub client to server collections addressing conventions


## Summary

This document tries to describe a simple set of conventions to better enable
the adressing of [ActivityPub] objects on servers that support [Client to
Server Interactions]. Its main purpose is to formalize a basic vocabulary for
defining subsets of IRIs [RFC-3987] for collections in a way that can be
generalized to both servers and clients. It builds upon the definition of query
parametrs [RFC-3986], by introducing a set of additional operators that can be
applied to values.

## What we are trying to solve

The main reason that is often cited as making client to server interactions
problematic is that the official specification leaves too much to the
implementors' discretion. The fact that there is no proscribed method of
filtering collections content is one of the stop gaps that prevents a wider
adoption of C2S in services and clients. <!-- This is the part we will be
focusing on. -->

## Syntax

The following syntax is extracted form RFC-3986 section 3.4, and it formalizes
the URL query parameters as representing any string that conforms to the
restrictions below between the first "?" character and the end of the URL or a
"#" character marking the start of the fragment part of the URL.

    query         = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )
    
    pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"
    
    unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
    
    pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
    
    sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

As we can see this is not formal definition of the query string as a group of
key and value pairs, but for our intended use, this is paramount.

So we will take this extra step ourselves and extend the definition to be:

    query         = *( query-pair [ qconcat ] )
    
    query-pair    = pname [ "=" ( pvalue ) ]
    
    pname         = 1*( pchar )
    
    pvalue        = *( pchar )
    
    pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / new-delims / ":" / "@"
    
    qconcat       = "&"
    
    unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
    
    pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
    
    new-delims    = "!" / "$" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" 

To allow for the operators that we want to append to the query values we extend this 
version with the following elements:

    query-pair    = p-name [ "=" ( [ p-operator ] p-value ) ]
    
    p-operator    = "!" / "~"
    
    p-value       =  empty-value / *( pchar )
    
    empty-value   = "-"

The operator symbols are "!" and "~" that correspond to negation respectively fuzzy 
matching of the query value.

Explicitly, when encountering a URL parameter value that has a "!" symbol in front
of it we mean it as "different than". Similarly when encountering a value prepended
with the "~" symbol, we mean it as "similar with" in a textual manner.

Additionally we added a nil value symbol "-" that can be used for operations where
the value to compare against is absent.

Please look at the following examples to see how these rules apply and compound with
one another:

    ?element=value
    // resources matching exactly "value"
    
    ?element=1&element=2
    // resources matching exactly "1" or "2"
    
    ?element=!value1
    // resources inversly matching "value1"
    
    ?element=!1&element=!2
    // resources inversly matching "1" and "2"
    
    ?element=~fuzzy
    // resources fuzzy matching "fuzzy"
    
    ?element=~one&element=~two
    // resources fuzzy matching "one" or "two"
    
    ?element=-
    // resources matching empty element values
    
    ?element=!-
    // resources matching all non empty element values

## Applicability for ActivityPub Collections

In this ection we will define how we are going to apply this newly defined
schema to use URL query parameters to filter ActivityPub collections.

We will assume a random ActvityPub collection can be found at the folowing URL:

    https://example.com/random-collection

The response to a GET request to this IRI could return something like:

    {
        "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "id": "https://example.com/random-collection",
        "name": "Random Collection",
        "type": "OrderedCollection",
        "updated": "2021-04-09T08:16:05Z",
        "first": "https://example.com/random-collection?maxItems=10",
        "totalItems": 12,
        "orderedItems": [ /* skipping items for brevity */ ]
    }

The filtering for the elements in the collection will be done by using URL
query parameters with the names corresponding to the different properties that
we want to filter on for the objects in the collection.

Example:

    https://example.com/random-collection?type=Place
    
    // will return only objects with the type `Place` that exist in the
    // Random Collection.
    
    https://example.com/random-collection?summary=~test%20example
    
    // will return only objects containing a summary property that contains
    // the "test example" text.

## Implementations

The grammar described in this document represents a simplified version of the
mechanism that services using the [GoActivityPub] library use for their C2S addressing.
