# FEP-9967: Polls

## Summary

How to make polls in [ActivityPub] network.

## History

Mastodon [implemented](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/10111) polls in 2019 ([documentation][MastodonPolls]).

ActivityStreams specification provides [recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#questions) for representing questions, but these recommendations were found to be impractical and the de-facto standard differs from them.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

## Question object

A poll is represented by a `Question` object. It MUST be published with `Create` activity (in contrast with [ActivityStreams vocabulary][ActivityVocabulary] where `Question` itself is defined as intransitive activity).

A `Question` object is typically structured similarly to a `Note`. In addition to common properties such as `attributedTo` and `content`, it MUST have one of the following:

- `oneOf`, if the poll requires choosing a single option.
- `anyOf`, if the poll allows choosing multiple options.

The value of this property MUST be an array of objects representing poll options:

- `type`: the `Note` string.
- `name`: the text of the poll option.
- `replies`: the total number of votes, as a collection:
    - `type`: the `Collection` string.
    - `totalItems`: the total number of votes for this poll option.

The `name` of a poll option MUST be unique within a poll. If the text contains custom emoji microsyntax, the corresponding `Emoji` objects are added to the `tag` array of the `Question` object.

The number of poll options is often limited, but the limit differs between implementations.

`Question` objects SHOULD also have an `endTime` property indicating the time when the poll ends. Polls without ending time are not widely supported. Some implementations use `closed` property instead of `endTime` or in addition to it (even if the poll is open). Consumers MUST process `closed` in the same way as `endTime`.

`Question` objects SHOULD have an `updated` property.

Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://social.example/polls/1",
  "type": "Question",
  "attributedTo": "https://social.example/actors/1",
  "to": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public",
  "content": "<p>Question</p>",
  "endTime": "2024-07-17T18:18:17Z",
  "updated": "2024-07-16T20:53:05Z",
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "type": "Note",
      "name": "Answer 1",
      "replies": {
        "type": "Collection",
        "totalItems": 596
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Note",
      "name": "Answer 2",
      "replies": {
        "type": "Collection",
        "totalItems": 379
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Voting

### Vote object

A vote is represented by a `Note` object with the following structure:

- `id`: the ID of the vote.
- `type`: the `Note` string.
- `attributedTo`: the actor that is making this vote.
- `inReplyTo`: the ID of the `Question` object.
- `name`: the value of the `name` property of the chosen poll option.
- `to`: the author of the poll.

The object MUST NOT have a `content` property.

This object is wrapped in a `Create` activity and sent to the author of the poll. If the poll is anonymous, this activity MUST NOT be delivered to anyone else.

When a poll allows multiple choices, each vote MUST be sent as a separate activity.

Example of a vote:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://social.example/votes/1",
  "type": "Note",
  "attributedTo": "https://social.example/actors/2",
  "inReplyTo": "https://social.example/polls/1",
  "name": "Answer 1",
  "to": "https://social.example/actors/1"
}
```

### Receiving a vote

The structure of a vote is very similar to a direct reply. It can be identified as a `Note` with `name` and `inReplyTo` properties, but without a `content` property.

>[!NOTE]
>The method of identifying votes described here is not reliable. An alternative representation is being discussed (the `Respond` activity).

Upon receving a vote, the author of the poll performs the following checks:

- The voter has a permission to vote (if the poll is not public).
- The poll is still active (if `endTime` is specified).
- The vote with the specified `id` is not already registered.
- The vote with the specified `name` is not already registered (if multiple choices are not allowed).

If any of these checks fails, the vote MUST be ignored.

Otherwise, the author of the poll updates the vote count for the specified poll option (the `totalItems` property of a corresponding `replies` collection). The value of the `updated` property is changed to the current date and time.

### Publishing results

When actor that published a poll receives a vote, it publishes an `Update` activity containing the `Question` object with updated results. This activity MUST be delivered to the audience of the poll and to every actor that voted in the poll.

## Editing options

The type of a poll (single choice / multiple choices) and its options might be changed at any time. In that case the author of the poll MUST reset the vote counts.

## Implementations

This document is based on implementations of polls in Mastodon and Pleroma.
