# FEP-ae97: Client-side activity signing

## Summary

Existing Fediverse servers manage signing keys on behalf of their users. This proposal describes a new kind of [ActivityPub][ActivityPub] client that lets users sign activities with their own keys, and a server that can distribute client-signed activities to other servers.

## History

[Initial version](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/commit/fc9c65daca267be9f91761ed854eac9e829222a2/fep/ae97/fep-ae97.md) of this proposal relied on linking of cryptographic identities to actor objects via [FEP-c390] identity proofs. That mechanism was superseded by [FEP-ef61] which achieves full data portability.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119][RFC-2119].

## Registering an actor

Client creates portable actor objects according to [FEP-ef61] and stores them.

Before registering a portable actor on the server, the client MUST add the server URL to the `gateways` array of the actor object.

To register the actor, the client sends an HTTP POST request to the gateway endpoint at `/.well-known/apgateway` path. The body of the request MUST be an actor object.

The server SHOULD limit registrations (for example, by requiring an invite code). If the server accepts registration request, it generates an RSA key and returns it in a response. The response MUST have the `201 Created` status code. The body of the response is a JSON object with an `assertionMethod` property. The value of this property is an array containing the RSA public key generated by the server in the [Multikey][CI-Multikey] format.

Example:

```json
{
  "assertionMethod": [
    {
      "type": "Multikey",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "z4MXj1wBzi9jUstyPMS4jQqB6KdJaiatPkAtVtGc6bQEQEEsKTic4G7Rou3iBf9vPmT5dbkm9qsZsuVNjq8HCuW1w24nhBFGkRE4cd2Uf2tfrB3N7h4mnyPp1BF3ZttHTYv3DLUPi1zMdkULiow3M1GfXkoC6DoxDUm1jmN6GBj22SjVsr6dxezRVQc7aj9TxE7JLbMH1wh5X3kA58H3DFW8rnYMakFGbca5CB2Jf6CnGQZmL7o5uJAdTwXfy2iiiyPxXEGerMhHwhjTA1mKYobyk2CpeEcmvynADfNZ5MBvcCS7m3XkFCMNUYBS9NQ3fze6vMSUPsNa6GVYmKx2x6JrdEjCk3qRMMmyjnjCMfR4pXbRMZa3i"
    }
  ]
}
```

The client MUST attach the RSA key to the actor object via `publicKey` property, and also add it to the `assertionMethod` array as described in [FEP-521a]. If the server's response contains other keys, they SHOULD be added to the `assertionMethod` array as well.

After updating the actor object, the client MUST publish an `Update` activity for it.

## Sending activities

Client submits signed [FEP-ef61] activities to actor's outbox. Contrary to what ActivityPub specification prescribes in section [6. Client to Server Interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions), the server MUST NOT overwrite the ID of activity. Instead of assigning a new ID, the server MUST verify that provided ID has not been used before. If activity ID is in compatible format (HTTP(S) URI), the server MUST check that its [origin][Origin] is the same as the server's origin. If the server accepts activity, its response MUST have `202 Accepted` status code.

If activity contains a wrapped object (as in `Create` and `Update` activities), it MUST be a portable object created according to [FEP-ef61]. The server MUST validate object IDs in the same way it validates activity IDs.

The server MUST deliver activities to their indended audiences without altering them. When signing HTTP requests, the server uses the RSA key generated during the registration.

## Receiving activities

Client receives activities by polling the actor's inbox.

Requests to inbox endpoint MUST have an [HTTP signature][HttpSig] created using a key associated with actor's DID authority (the "authority" component of actor's ID).
