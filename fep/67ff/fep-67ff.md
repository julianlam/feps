# FEP-67ff: FEDERATION.md

## Summary

`FEDERATION.md` is a file containing information necessary for achieving interoperability with a federated service. It was originally proposed by Darius Kazemi on SocialHub forum in [Documenting federation behavior in a semi-standard way?](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/documenting-federation-behavior-in-a-semi-standard-way/453) topic.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

## Structure

The `FEDERATION.md` file can have arbitrary structure and content. The only requirements are:

- It MUST be a valid Markdown document.
- It MUST be located in the root of a project's code repository. If project's documentation is located in another place, the `FEDERATION.md` file may contain a link to that location.
- It SHOULD include a list of implemented federation protocols.
- It SHOULD include a list of supported Fediverse Enhancement Proposals (FEPs).

## Template
