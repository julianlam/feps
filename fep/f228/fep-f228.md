# FEP-f228: Backfilling conversations

## Summary

The most common conversation backfill method is based on recursive retrieval of posts indicated by `inReplyTo` property and posts contained in `replies` collections. This is inefficient.

[FEP-7888: Demystifying the context property][FEP-7888] suggests using the `context` property for grouping related objects (such as posts in a conversation). This property can resolve to a collection, which can be used for efficient backfilling without recursion.

Two different implementations of `context` collection exist: collection of posts and collection of activities.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

## Collection of posts

This collection represents a [thread] and contains all posts in a conversation, from the perspective of the conversation owner.

It is an `OrderedCollection`, and the order of items is chronological. It MUST contain at least one item, the top-level post. This post MUST have a `context` property referring to the collection. Other posts might not have this property.

When `context` property is present on a post, it MUST resolve to a collection of posts.

There is a difference between contents of this collection and a reply tree defined by `inReplyTo` and `replies` relationships, because conversation owner might choose to not include certain replies.

## Collection of activities

This collection contains all activities related to posts in a conversation, including but not limited to:

- `Create`
- `Update`
- `Delete`
- `Like`

It is an `OrderedCollection`, and the order of items is chronological. It MUST contain at least one item, the `Create` activity for the top-level post. This activity MUST have a `context` property referring to the collection. Other activities might not have this property.

When `context` property is present on an activity, it MUST resolve to a collection of activities.

### Compatibility with Conversation Containers

In [Conversation Containers][FEP-171b] this collection would coincide with the conversation container. It will contain `Add` activities in addition to other activities.

### `history` property

Collections described in this document can be implemented separately.

If both of them are implemented, the `history` property can be added to a collection of posts, indicating a corresponding collection of activities. This property is defined in [FEP-bad1: Object history collection][FEP-bad1], although the use case here differs from the one described in that proposal.

### `contextHistory` property

`contextHistory` property can be used to make a reference from a post to a collection of activities.

## Reading collections

After top-level post of a conversation is discovered, the whole conversation can be retrieved using the following algorithm:

- If `contextHistory` property is present, retrieve collection of activities and stop.
- If `context` property is present, retrieve collection of posts and stop.
- If `replies` property is present, retrieve collection of replies, and repeat this step for every reply.
