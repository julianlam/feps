# FEP-171b: Conversation Containers

## Summary

This document specifies a model for managing conversations in [ActivityPub] network. It is based on the implementation of [Conversation Containers][Containers] in [Streams](https://codeberg.org/streams/streams).

In this model conversations are represented as collections controlled by a single actor. Such conversations take place within a specific audience and may be moderated.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

## Containers

A conversation container is implemented as a collection. Every item in that collection is an `Add` activity where `object` is another activity (such as `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Like`, `Dislike`, `EmojiReact` or `Announce`). The conversation owner distributes `Add` activities to other participants, thus keeping their views of the conversation synchronized.

### Container collection

- Collection type MUST be `OrderedCollection`.
- Collection items MUST be in chronological order.
- Collection MUST have an `attributedTo` property containing the `id` of the conversation owner.
- Collection SHOULD have `collectionOf` property with value `Activity`.

>[!NOTE]
>The required collection type might be changed to a more descriptive one (such as `Context`) in a future version of this document. That will allow identification of `Add` activities belonging to a conversation container by the value of `Add.target.type`.

>[!NOTE]
>In addition to the conversation container collection, implementers MAY provide collection that represents the conversation tree and contains posts.

### Adding activities to a conversation

Conversation owner can add any activity to the conversation. However, if a `context` property is present on the activity, its value SHOULD be identical to the ID of a conversation container.

When activity is added to the conversation, its owner sends an `Add` activity to the conversation audience (usually defined by a top-level post).

`Add` activities published by the conversation owner MUST have a `target` property containing a partial object:

- `type`: `OrderedCollection`
- `id`: the `id` of the conversation container.
- `attributedTo`: the `id` of the collection owner.

`Add` activities published by the conversation owner MUST be added to the conversation container collection.

>[!NOTE]
>The "conversation outbox" model where the `target` of `Add` activity is a collection of `Add` activities is not compatible with ActivityStreams definition of [Add](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-add) activity, according to which *Add activity indicates that the actor has added the object to the target*.

### Top-level post

The author of a top-level post it not necessarily the conversation owner. When owner is a group, conversations can be started by any of its members.

The top-level post SHOULD have a `context` property indicating the conversation container.

>[!NOTE]
>The usage of a `context` property in conversation containers differs from recommendations provided in [FEP-7888]. The name of this property might be changed in a future version of this document (e.g. to `contextHistory`).

### Interactions

All activities in a conversation SHOULD only be delivered to the conversation owner.

Conversation participants SHOULD reject conversation activities that have not been added to the conversation by its owner.

The audience of a reply MUST be copied from a conversation root.

Reply with a different audience can be created by starting a new conversation and including a [FEP-e232] link to the post instead of specifying it in `inReplyTo`.

### Moderation

When conversation owner does not want to add activity to a conversation, that activity is ignored and a corresponding `Add` activity is not published.

To remove a previously approved post from a conversation, its owner publishes a `Delete` activity where `object` is the post that must be removed. This activity is then wrapped in `Add` activity and distributed to the conversation audience.

>[!NOTE]
>Actor shouldn't be able to delete objects it didn't create. In a future version of this document `Delete` might be replaced with `Remove(target: Thread)`.

### Backfilling

Conversation participants can retrieve missing activities by reading the conversation container collection.

## Authentication

When an ActivityPub server receives an `Add` activity in its inbox, it MUST perform the authentication procedure according to [FEP-fe34]:

- If `Add.object` is not embedded, fetch it. If location of the fetched activity has the same origin as `Add.object`, add it to the conversation.
- If `Add.object` is embedded, check whether `Add.actor` and `Add.object.actor` have the same origin.
- If origins are equal, add `Add.object` to the conversation.
- If origins are different and [FEP-8b32] integrity proof is present, verify the proof. If the proof is valid, add `Add.object` to the conversation.
- If integrity proof is not present, fetch `Add.object` by its `id`. If location of the fetched activity has the same origin as `Add.object.id`, add fetched activity to the conversation.

The processing of unauthenticated embedded activities is strongly discouraged. If such activities are not rejected by the consumer, a malicious conversation owner may be able to perform a [cache poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_poisoning) attack and overwrite any actor or a post in consumer's local cache by sending a forged `Update(Actor)` or `Update(Object)` wrapped in an `Add` activity.

>[!WARNING]
>Sometimes activities have non-dereferenceable identifiers. That may prevent their authentication.

## Examples

Example of an `Add` activity for a reply to a followers-only post:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
  ],
  "type": "Add",
  "id": "https://alice.example/activities/add/1",
  "actor": "https://alice.example/actors/1",
  "object": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
    ],
    "type": "Create",
    "id": "https://bob.example/activities/create/1",
    "actor": "https://bob.example/actors/1",
    "context": "https://alice.example/contexts/1",
    "object": {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
      ],
      "type": "Note",
      "id": "https://bob.example/posts/1",
      "inReplyTo": "https://alice.example/posts/1",
      "content": "This is a reply",
      "to": [
        "https://alice.example/actors/1",
        "https://alice.example/actors/1/followers"
      ]
    },
    "to": [
      "https://alice.example/actors/1",
      "https://alice.example/actors/1/followers"
    ]
  },
  "target": {
    "type": "OrderedCollection",
    "id": "https://alice.example/contexts/1",
    "attributedTo": "https://alice.example/actors/1"
  },
  "to": [
    "https://bob.example/actors/1",
    "https://alice.example/actors/1/followers"
  ]
}
```

Example of a container of a followers-only conversation:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://w3id.org/fep/171b"
  ],
  "type": "OrderedCollection",
  "id": "https://alice.example/contexts/1",
  "attributedTo": "https://alice.example/actors/1",
  "collectionOf": "Activity",
  "orderedItems": [
    "https://alice.example/activities/add/1"
  ]
}
```

## Comparison with other proposals

- [FEP-400e]: The `object` of `Add` is an object, not an activity, and conversation collection contains added objects. `Reject(Create)` activity is generated for rejected posts. Conversation participants are expected to add a `target` property to posts.
- [FEP-1b12](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/1b12/fep-1b12.md): `Announce` activity is used instead of `Add`. Conversation and related activities are synchronized between participants, but conversation backfilling mechanism is not specified.
- [GoToSocial Interaction Policy](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/federation/posts/#interaction-policy): conversation is managed separately for each post (in a conversation container the owner has authority over the entire thread). `Accept` or `Reject` activity is generated for every interaction (in a conversation container `Add` activity is generated when activity is approved, and rejected activities are ignored). Conversation is not synchronized between participants, but can be backfilled by recursively fetching `replies` collections.
