# FEP-9098: Custom emojis

## Summary

A custom emoji is a small image used to express an idea or emotion. Custom emojis are different from Unicode emojis, which are sequences of characters.

This document describes how custom emojis are implemented in the [ActivityPub] network.

## History

Custom emojis were introduced by Pleroma ([commits](https://gitgud.io/lambadalambda/pleroma/-/compare/c17c8ce36d35db03a007a264cc2e507afa9b803e...7c82b8219734102ff24d9dc24226c08351e608cc)) and Mastodon ([PR](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/4988)) in 2017.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

## Emoji object

Custom emojis are represented as `Emoji` objects (the full type IRI is `http://joinmastodon.org/ns#Emoji`). The `Emoji` object has the following properties:

- `id` (RECOMMENDED): the unique identifier of the custom emoji. Some implementations omit this property (i.e. the object is anonymous).
- `type` (REQUIRED): the literal string `Emoji`.
- `name` (REQUIRED): the [shortcode][Shortcode] of the custom emoji (the name of the emoji, enclosed in colons; see [Microsyntax](#microsyntax) section).
- `updated` (OPTIONAL): the date when custom emoji was updated, formatted as [RFC-3339] date and time string.
- `icon` (REQUIRED): the `Image` object describing the emoji image.
  - `type` (REQUIRED): the literal string `Image`.
  - `url` (REQUIRED): the URI of the image to use as the emoji.

>[!NOTE]
>The definition of the `icon` property in ActivityStreams Vocabulary recommends an aspect ratio of one to one, but in practice custom emojis have varied aspect ratios.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "https://social.example/emoji/blobcat",
  "type": "Emoji",
  "name": ":blobcat:",
  "updated": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "icon": {
    "type": "Image",
    "url": "https://social.example/media/blobcat.png"
  }
}
```

### Uniqueness

The primary unique identifier of a custom emoji is a combination of its name and the domain name. The domain name can be extracted from the `id` of `Emoji` object or from the `id` of the object within which it is embedded.

If a publisher doesn't guarantee that emoji `id` is globally unique, it MUST NOT add this property.

### Accessibility

The short description of a custom emoji can be specified with the `alternateName` property (the full IRI is `http://schema.org/alternateName`).

## Using custom emojis

### Microsyntax

In text a custom emoji is represented by its [shortcode][Shortcode], which is a name of an emoji enclosed in colons (e.g. `:blobcat:`). This is also the value of the `Emoji` object's `name` property.

These textual representations are often inserted into values of `name`, `summary` and `content` properties of the object that embeds the custom emoji. E.g., the `content` of a `Note`, or the `name` of an `Actor`.

The corresponding `Emoji` objects are added to the `tag` array of the object. Within that array custom emojis can appear in any order.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "Note",
  "id": "https://social.example/notes/1234",
  "content": "<p>:blobcat:</p>",
  "tag": [
    {
      "id": "https://social.example/emoji/blobcat",
      "type": "Emoji",
      "name": ":blobcat:",
      "icon": {
        "type": "Image",
        "url": "https://social.example/media/blobcat.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Right-to-left text

Custom emoji shortcodes are always written left-to-right, even in right-to-left text.

### Rendering

#### General client considerations

The aspect ratio of an image SHOULD be preserved. The maximum width of an image MAY be limited.

Shortcodes inside `<code>` and `<pre>` HTML elements MUST NOT be replaced.

#### Web client considerations

Web applications typically replace custom emoji shortcodes with `<img>` HTML tags and render the output as HTML.

To prevent [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)][XSS] attacks, implementers MUST ensure that:

- Emoji names, descriptions, URLs and other strings that are used in replacements do not contain reserved HTML characters (`&<>"'`).
- When HTML content (e.g. `summary`, `content`) is processed, shortcodes are replaced only inside [Text][DOM-Text] nodes.
- Reserved HTML characters in text are escaped before replacing shortcodes.

## Compatibility

In order to be compatible with as many servers as possible, implementations SHOULD comply with the following additional requirements:

- Name contains at least two characters ([Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/v4.3.7/app/models/custom_emoji.rb#L28)).
- Name contains only characters from the `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` set ([Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/v4.3.7/app/models/custom_emoji.rb#L30)).
- Image media type is `image/png`, `image/gif` or `image/webp` ([Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/v4.3.7/app/models/custom_emoji.rb#L37)).
- Image size is not greater than 256 KB ([Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/v4.3.7/app/models/custom_emoji.rb#L27)).
- Image is a square (some clients may display non-square emojis with a wrong aspect ratio).
- Shortcode is placed between two characters that are not unicode alphanumerics, colons or line endings ([Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/v4.4.2/app/models/custom_emoji.rb#L32-L34), see also issue [#7364](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/7364)).

## Implementations

This document is based on implementations of custom emojis in Pleroma, Mastodon, Misskey and Fedibird.
