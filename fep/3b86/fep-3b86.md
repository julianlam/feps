# FEP-3b86: Activity Intents

## Summary
"Activity Intents" extend the capabilities of an ActivityPub server beyond a user's outbox, and enable direct interactions with content on the wider social web. They do this by publishing a machine-readable list of public URLs where users can perform key activities (such as `Follow`, `Like`, or `Announce`)  allowing other websites to initiate remote social interactions without cumbersome copying/pasting of URL strings.

## 1. Requirements
The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119.html).

For the purposes of this document, a "Home Server" is the location where a user is logged in, and that publishes the Actor's Activity Intents via WebFinger.  A "Remote Server" is another location on the Internet that the user wants to interact with, and that will request/receive those intents via WebFinger.

## 2. History
Most centralized social media services have widgets that allow users on the wider Internet to interact with their social services.  These include "like" and "share" buttons that third-party websites embed into their content, and link users back to their corresponding social media account.

This is difficult to achieve in a federated environment.

There have been other attempts to make a "Share on Mastodon" button that performs a similar action on the Fediverse.  But these tasks are implemented differently by different Fediverse servers.  For example, Mastodon uses `/share`, while Hubzilla uses `/rpost`.  Parameters to each application are often different, using variations of `text`, `title`, `url`, and other values.

The lack of a unified standard has led developers to hard-code endpoints for each distinct application.  This is brittle and vulnerable to changes by server authors.  It also pins those URL endpoints, making them difficult for servers to change in the future without breaking an unknown number of "share" buttons out in the wild.

What is needed is a systematic way for each server to announce the endpoint URLs that they support.

## 3. Activity Intents
In the most basic terms, Activity Intents expand on the common Fediverse use of [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net) in [FEP-4adb](https://w3id.org/fep/4adb) to include mappings between any [Activity Type](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#activity-types) and the URL endpoint where that user can perform it. This expands and standardizes the "remote follow" workflow that was used by oStatus protocol, but has not been fully implemented by newer Fediverse applications and no longer has a public specification document.

When generating a WebFinger result for a user account, servers supporting Activity Intents SHOULD respond with one or more intent links in the ["links" property](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7033#section-4.4.4). Activity Intent links MUST have `rel` and `href` properties.  All others properties are ignored.

### 3.1. Example
Here is an example response from a WebFinger server which includes three Activity Intents appended to the end of its `links` property.

```json
{
  "subject": "acct:benpate@mastodon.social",
  "aliases": [
    "https://mastodon.social/@benpate",
    "https://mastodon.social/users/benpate"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",
      "type": "text/html",
      "href": "https://mastodon.social/@benpate"
    },
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "type": "application/activity+json",
      "href": "https://mastodon.social/users/benpate"
    },
    {
      "rel": "http://ostatus.org/schema/1.0/subscribe",
      "template": "https://mastodon.social/authorize_interaction?uri={uri}"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://w3id.org/fep/3b86/Follow",
      "href": "https://mastodon.social/authorize_interaction?uri={object}"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://w3id.org/fep/3b86/Create",
      "href": "https://mastodon.social/share?uri={object}"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://w3id.org/fep/3b86/Like",
      "template": "https://mastodon.social/intents/like?id={object}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.2. Required Link Properties

**rel**: Activity Intents use the `https://w3id.org/fep/3b86/*` (as described in [FEP-888d](https://w3id.org/fep/8886)) to designate the kind of activity intent, where `*` represents the particular Activity the user intends to perform.  These relations -- such as `https://w3id.org/fep/3b86/Follow`, and `https://w3id.org/fep/3b86/Create` -- are listed in detail below.

**href**: Links also use the standard WebFinger `href` property,  but also include wrapped replace values (as in `{uri}` or `{name}`) to designate parameters to be injected by the caller.  (note: this is in contrast to the non-standard `template` property that was used by oStatus)

Parameter names are chosen to correspond with [Activity Vocabulary properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#properties) and may differ from parameters used by pre-existing implementations.

To prevent unrecognized properties from corrupting a workflow:
* Remote servers MUST be able to replace all recognized values with the appropriate string.
* Remote servers MUST replace unrecognized values with an empty string.

### 3.3 Template Parameters
In all cases, Activity Intents intentionally use the property names defined in the W3C standard [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary). However, intents must fit into a URL, and must use commonly understood fields.  So, Intent parameters can only use IDs -- URL references to JSON-LD resources available elsewhere on the Internet.

In addition, remote servers MUST [Percent Encode](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) all values replaced in the href template.

### 3.4 Workflow Redirects
Activity Intents MAY include additional query parameters `on-success` and `on-cancel` that allow home servers to return users to their original workflow on the remote server:

**on-success** - If present in the link template, this value signifies a URL that the home server SHOULD redirect clients to once the Activity Intent workflow is complete.  If this parameter is missing, then the resulting page is left up to the home server to choose.

**on-cancel** - If present in the link template, this value signifies a URL that the home server SHOULD redirect clients to if they abort the Activity Intent workflow.  If this parameter is missing, then the resulting page is left up to the home server to choose.

### 3.5 Endpoint Expectations
The user's home server is a trusted environment that manages the user's sign-in status along with the rest of their social inbox and outbox.  When the remote server links to an Activity Intent provided by the home server, the layout, fields, and UI are all determined by the home server

Remote servers MAY open Activity Intent links in many different environments, such as:
1. a full browser window
2. a small pop-up window
3. a mobile app HTML view
4. or other constrained environments.

Home servers SHOULD build their UI with minimal assumptions so that the endpoint will fit well into as many environments as possible.  Home servers may not be aware f the remote server opens the Activity Intent link in a separate popup window, so remote servers SHOULD include `on-success` and `on-cancel` parameters that redirect back to its own pages so that it can close the pop-up itself.

## 5.0. Security Considerations and CSRF issues
This FEP does not expose any additional attack vectors, but only documents the endpoints that already exist within the server.  Still, it is important to reiterate some key security practices to prevent [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) vulnerabilities.

* Remote Servers MUST only send `GET` requests to Home Servers.
* Home Servers MUST NOT change data based on GET requests.
* Home Servers SHOULD protect these published endpoints by generating CSRF tokens and including them with every POST request.  This validates that the request originated on the user's home server, and was initiated by the user. See [OWASP Related Controls](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf#related-controls) for in-depth discussion.

## 6.0. Remote Servers: The Rest of the Equation
This FEP provides the prerequisite information required for a "Home Server" publish Activity Intents for its Actors.  It does not specify how "Remote Servers" will use this information - i.e., how they implement "share" and "like" buttons in their content.

### 6.1. Remote Server Example
Here is a brief example of the workflow as implemented by a remote server:

1. A user visits a remote server (i.e., any address on the Internet where they do not have an ActivityPub account)
2. The remote server displays buttons such as "like" or "share" for a particular document or object.
3. When the user clicks on one of these links, the remote server checks to see if the user is already recognized.  This does not necessarily mean logged in, or authenticated, just whether or not the user has entered their home server credentials before.  True authentication on the remote server is not necessary for Activity Intents to work.
	1. If the user is not recognized, then they are prompted to enter their Fediverse ID (such as @benpate@mastodon.social).  The remote server can save this information for use in the future (preferably in a private data store, such as `localStorage`)
	2. If the user is recognized, this means they have already completed step 3.1, and can continue to step 4.
4. The remote server uses a standard WebFinger query to look up the user's Fediverse ID and searches for Activity Intents supported by the user's home server.
	1. If none are found, the remote server MAY try to substitute fallback values for known server types.
	2. If none are found (and no fallbacks substituted) the remote server SHOULD inform the user that their account is incompatible with the selected feature and halt the workflow.
5. The remote server replaces values into the designated href template and forwards the user to the assigned page on their home server.  This initiates the Activity Intent workflow on their home server.
6. When the user completes the workflow, the home server SHOULD use URL in the `on-success` parameter to redirect the user back to the correct page on the remote server.
	1. Similarly, if the user cancels the workflow, the home server SHOULD use the URL in the `on-cancel` parameter to redirect the user back to the correct page on the remote server.

### 6.2. Fallbacks for Unpublished Links
Remote servers MAY also account for applications that do not publish Activity Intents, but whose endpoints are still well known.  In this case, remote servers SHOULD use Activity Intents links if they are present, then fall back to older links (such as the oStatus `/authorize_interaction` endpoint) if they are present, then fall back to hard-coded values (such as the Mastodon `/share` endpoint) if no other values exist.
