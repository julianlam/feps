# FEP-9091: Export Actor Service Endpoint

## Summary

This FEP defines an API endpoint used to initiate the "Export Actor" operation.
The output and semantics of the _result_ of the export operation is out of scope, and left
to subsequent FEPs.
The endpoint only specifies how to _start_ the operation, and by extension, how to tell if
a given Actor's server supports this operation.

## Data Model: Export Service Endpoint

Conforming ActivityPub Actor profiles MUST specify their export API endpoints using the
`service` descriptor property (inspired by the 
[DID Core Services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services) section, and used in other
FEPs such as [FEP-e3e9: Actor Relative URLs][FEP-e3e9]):

* The expanded `type` of the service descriptor object MUST be `https://w3id.org/fep/9091#Export` (see example below).
* The `service` property MUST NOT contain more than one node with the `#Export` type.
    - If a client encounters multiple service descriptor objects with type ending in
      `#Export`, the client SHOULD just use the first entry.

### Example Actor Profile with Export Service Endpoint

```js
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://alice-personal-site.example/actor",
  "type": "Person",
  "name": "Alice",
  "service": [{
    "id": "https://alice-personal-site.example/actor#export",
    "type": "https://w3id.org/fep/9091#Export",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://alice-personal-site.example/actor/accountExport"
  }]
}
```

## Protocol: Initiating the Export Actor Operation

If a client conforming to this FEP wishes to start the 'Export Actor' process, such as to
create a backup of the Actor profile, its private key material, and all content associated
with this actor, the client MUST perform the following steps:

1. Fetch the Actor profile object.
2. Locate the `service` description object with the expanded `type` equal to `https://w3id.org/fep/9091#Export`.
3. Locate the corresponding `serviceEndpoint` URL, in that description object.

    * If no such service description item exists, this means that the server hosting the
      Actor's profile does not support this operation.

4. The client makes an HTTP `POST` to the URL in the `serviceEndpoint` to initiate the
   export operation.

    * The client MUST include appropriate authorization credentials that indicate that
      it is authorized to perform this operation (that it's authorized to receive the
      highly private result of account export). The exact format of these authorization
      credentials is out of scope of this FEP.

### Example Request and Response

Example synchronous request (with an empty body) and response:

```http
POST /actor/accountExport HTTP/1.1
Host: alice-personal-site.example
Authorization: Bearer ....
Accept: application/x-tar
Content-Length: 0
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/x-tar
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

<binary data of the resulting .tar file>
```
