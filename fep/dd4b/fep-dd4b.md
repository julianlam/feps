# FEP-dd4b: Quote Posts

## Summary

This FEP describes the mechanism defined in [Activity Streams 2.0][AS2] and the [Activity Vocabulary][Vocabulary] for making quote posts, that is, [Announce](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce) activities with additional commentary.

## Motivation

Redistributing content or activities created by other actors is a key activity on the social web. The [Announce](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce) activity type is defined in Activity Streams 2.0 ("AS2") to represent this activity. `Announce` is used in ActivityPub to provide sharing functionality; see [7.11 Announce Activity (sharing)](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#announce-activity-inbox).

The [Activity](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-activity) object type in AS2 inherits all the properties of the [Object](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-activity) type. This means that **all** activity types have a rich set of properties for representation as first-class content on the social web. The `Announce` type is no exception.

However, the ActivityPub specification does not describe how to use those properties to provide additional commentary, metadata, and files for the shared content. Called ["quote Tweets"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(social_media)#Quote_tweets), "repost with comment", or ["quote posts"](https://help.instagram.com/279780184399513), this kind of extended sharing gives additional context to shared objects.

This FEP describes how to use the `content` property to provide this commentary, as well as other properties that may be useful in this context. It is applicable to uses of Activity Streams 2.0 in general; where it applies to ActivityPub, it is noted.

## Specification

- The `object` property of an `Announce` activity MUST be a reference to the shared content. It MAY be an AS2 `Object` or a `Link`, either as a JSON object or as a URL.
- The `content` property of an `Announce` activity MAY be used to provide additional commentary on the shared content.
- The `attachment` property of an `Announce` activity MAY be used to provide additional media content related to the shared content or the commentary.
- The `tag` property of an `Announce` activity MAY be used to provide additional metadata, such as [Mention](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-mention) objects or [Hashtag][Miscellany] objects, about the shared content or the commentary.
- The `inReplyTo` property of an `Announce` activity MAY be used to connect an `Announce` activity to another object as a reply. The replied-to object MAY be the shared content, but this is unusual; it MAY also be part of a separate conversation.
- An `Announce` activity with an `inReplyTo` property SHOULD be included in the `replies` collection of the object being replied to.
- `Announce` activities SHOULD be counted as part of the `shares` collection of the shared content, regardless of any additional properties, as defined in [7.11 Announce Activity (sharing)](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#announce-activity-inbox).

## Examples

### Basic Quote Post

```

### Quote Post with Mention

This represents a quote post with a mention, where the actor is sharing a note from another actor with commentary and a mention.

  "tag": {
    "type": "Mention",
    "href": "https://example.com/users/jeff",
    "name": "jeff"
  }
}
```

The author of the quoted material can also be mentioned.

  "tag": {
    "type": "Mention",
    "href": "https://example.com/users/franklin",
    "name": "franklin"
  }
}
```

### Quote Post as Reply

A quote post can be used as a reply, often to share evidence or information from another source.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://example.com/activities/rrrsssttt",
  "type": "Note",
  "actor": "https://example.com/users/jeff",
  "to": "https://example.com/users/jeff/followers",
  "content": "Does anyone know where I can find a good article on Cretan geology?",
  "replies": {
    "id": "https://example.com/activities/rrrsssttt/replies",
    "type": "Collection",
    "totalItems": 1,
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "https://example.com/activities/lllmmnnoo",
        "type": "Announce",
        "actor": "https://example.com/users/evan",
        "object": {
          "id": "https://example.com/notes/1234",
          "type": "Note",
          "attributedTo": "https://example.com/users/franklin"
        },
        "content": "<a href='https://example.com/users/jeff'>@jeff</a> you might like this Cretan geology article.",
        "tag": {
          "type": "Mention",
          "href": "https://example.com/users/jeff",
          "name": "jeff"
        },
        "inReplyTo": "https://example.com/activities/rrrsssttt"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## User interface guidance

A common representation of quote posts is to include the `object` of the `Announce` as an embedded card or other representation, with the `content` of the `Announce` object as introductory text.

## Security considerations

For all `Announce` activities, it's important to consider how much of the shared content to expose to the recipient of the `Announce` activity. Using an URL as a reference, or including a limited set of metadata as in the examples in this FEP, allows the publishing server for the shared content to control access to the content. See [Inclusion of the shared object](https://www.w3.org/wiki/ActivityPub/Primer/Announce_activity#Inclusion_of_the_shared_object) in the [ActivityPub Primer][Primer] for more information.
